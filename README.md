## DeepCrysTet: A Deep Learning Approach Using Tetrahedral Mesh for Predicting Properties of Crystalline Materials

DeepCrysTet is a novel deep learning approach for predicting material properties, which uses crystal structures represented as a 3D tetrahedral mesh generated by Delaunay tetrahedralization.
DeepCrysTet provides a useful framework comprising three core components: a 3D mesh generation method, mesh-based feature design, and neural network design.
The overall framework of DeepCrysTet is shown below.
